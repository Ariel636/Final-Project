<h1>Hello, my name is Mirabbos and this is my final project for a course from Harvard University on web programming with Python and JavaScript(CS50).</h1>

# Distinctiveness and Complexity: 
<p1>Well, I think that this is quite a complex and very useful site suitable for all requirements. The inspiration to create this site came when I started choosing universities for my College List, because the functions of this site include finding universities under the set filters of location and complexity of admission. I also used this very idea because over the past few months I have been deep into the admission process and decided to create something that I had not found before, but something that would be very useful for me. I used the universities of the famous Ivy League as the initial list. Also, the difficulty in creating this site arose when creating the interaction of the site Administrator and the user when registering on the Mailing List.</p1>

# Components and File Targets: 
<p>favourite.html - The page of the site where the universities added to the College List are displayed.<p>
<p>filterby.html - A website page that displays universities selected for the appropriate filters.</p>
<p>index.html - The main page of the site, which displays all the existing university options proposed by the Administrator. Also from there you can go to the page of each university, as well as order filters for choosing a university.</p>
<p>layout.html - The top tab for each page of the site, there are links leading to the home page, College List, as well as a link for Log out.</p>
<p>login.htnl , register.html - Pages for user authorization.</p>
<p>profile.html - A page notifying the user about the successful completion of the form for registration in the Mailing List.</p>
<p>singlecollege.html - A page showing information about the selected university, as well as for registration in the Mailing List. And also leave comments under any page of the university.</p>
